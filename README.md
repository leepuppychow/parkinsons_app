Option 4: Original Idea
That’s right. You are creative and I believe in you. Feel free to pitch an original idea for the mini-project.

Must-Haves:
[ ] Deploy to Heroku
[ ] Authentication/Authorization
[X] One-to-many and Many-to-many relationships
[ ] Styling
Approval
In order to have your project approved, send a slack message to your instructors with answers to the following questions:

[ ] What will a visitor be able to do?
[ ] What will a logged in user be able to do?
[ ] What will an admin be able to do?
[ ] What is a one-to-many relationship you will be using?
[ ] What is a many-to-many relationship you will be using?
Things to Consider
If you choose to do this option make sure you try to implement all the concepts we’ve touched over the last week. For example:

[ ] TDD - model and feature tests
[ ] CRUD
[ ] 1-1 and 1-many relationships
[ ] ReST-ful routes
[ ] Well structured relational database design
[ ] Rails helpers
[ ] Sessions, flashes and maybe cookies if you have a good use case for them.
[ ] Authentication
[ ] Authorization

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
